## R Markdown

For all submissions to the Population Demographics Lab (PDL) authors are required to provide a set of code which replicates the output (tables, figures, etc) of their analysis. For now the PDL is only accepting submissions which use the `R` programming language. Code for the submission must be hosted on a public facing archive at the time of the submission, which will be copied and stored such that it meets NSF scientific reproducibility guidelines. The format of each project should resemeble the directory structure seen below. 

```
project
│   README.md
│   main.R
│   ...
│
└───R
│   │   00_support_code.R
│   │   01_pre_run.R
│   │   ...
│
└───folder2
    │   my_data.csv
    │   more_data.txt
    │   ...
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
